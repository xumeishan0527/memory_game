===
The game contains 16 grids of "cards". Round cards consist of 8 pairs of different cards, each with a different symbol on each side. The cards are randomly arranged on the grid with the symbol down. The rules of the game are simple: open two hidden cards at a time and find the matching card!   
Each round of game:
  - The player opens a card to see what the symbol is.
  - The player then opens the second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
  - If the cards match, both cards remain open.
  - If the cards do not match, both cards continue to cover up.

When all the cards are correctly matched, the game is over.
